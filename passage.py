passage1 = """Merely convincing your children that worry is senseless and that they would be more content if they didn’t worry isn’t going to stop them from worrying.
For some reason, young people seem to believe that worry is a fact of life over which they have little or no control.
Consequently, they don’t even try to stop.
Therefore, you need to convince them that worry, like guilt and fear, is nothing more than an emotion,
and like all emotions, is subject to the power of the will.
Tell them that they can eliminate worry from their lives by simply refusing to attend to it.
Explain to them that if they refuse to act worried regardless of how they feel,
they will eventually stop feeling worried
and will begin to experience the contentment that accompanies a worry­free life.
This approach helps them take control of their emotions rather than be controlled by them."""

passage2 = """People often underestimate the power of small daily habits.
Waking up early, reading a few pages, or exercising for ten minutes may seem insignificant.
However, the cumulative effect of these habits can be life-changing over time.
A person who consistently reads can develop deeper understanding and empathy.
Likewise, short daily workouts can significantly improve physical and mental health.
The key is not the intensity, but the consistency of the effort.
Tiny actions compound like interest, leading to massive growth.
Most success stories are built not on sudden bursts of effort but on steady persistence.
Therefore, focus on what you do every day, not just once in a while.
Eventually, your habits will define your future more than your goals will."""

passage3 = """When people talk about creativity, they often think of artists and musicians.
But creativity is not limited to the arts.
It exists in science, business, education, and even daily problem-solving.
Creativity is the ability to see patterns others miss and to connect ideas in new ways.
It thrives in environments that encourage curiosity and risk-taking.
Many people suppress their creativity because they fear failure or criticism.
However, the creative process always involves some level of uncertainty.
Those who embrace discomfort are more likely to innovate.
Encouraging creativity means giving yourself permission to explore and make mistakes.
In the end, creativity is a mindset, not a talent limited to a few."""

passage4 = """Technology has transformed the way we communicate and interact.
Social media platforms have made it easier to stay connected with friends and family.
However, they have also introduced challenges such as reduced face-to-face interactions.
People now spend more time looking at screens than engaging in real conversations.
This shift affects our ability to build deep, meaningful relationships.
In addition, the constant stream of information can cause stress and anxiety.
Despite these issues, technology is not inherently harmful.
It depends on how we choose to use it in our daily lives.
By setting boundaries and using tech mindfully, we can enjoy its benefits without losing balance.
Awareness and discipline are essential for healthy digital habits."""

passage5 = """Failure is often seen as something negative, but it is a crucial part of success.
Every great innovator or leader has experienced failure at some point.
What separates them from others is how they respond to it.
Instead of giving up, they use failure as a learning experience.
It teaches resilience, adaptability, and humility.
Failure forces us to reflect and rethink our approach.
Without it, progress would be impossible.
The fear of failing prevents many people from even trying.
By embracing failure, we open ourselves to growth and improvement.
Ultimately, failure is not the opposite of success—it is a stepping stone to it."""

passage6 = """Many people believe that success is about working longer and harder than everyone else.
While dedication is important, overworking often leads to burnout and reduced productivity.
Studies show that taking regular breaks can actually improve focus and creativity.
Successful people prioritize rest and recovery just as much as effort.
This balance allows them to sustain performance over the long term.
It’s not about how many hours you put in, but how effectively you use your time.
Learning to work smarter, not harder, is essential in today’s fast-paced world.
Time management and setting boundaries are skills that support this approach.
Taking care of your mental and physical health is a form of productivity too.
In the end, sustainable success comes from balance, not exhaustion."""

passage7 = """Humans are naturally curious and driven to explore the unknown.
This trait has led to incredible achievements, from discovering new lands to exploring space.
Curiosity fuels scientific research and technological advancement.
However, the desire to know everything can sometimes lead to frustration or misinformation.
Not all questions have immediate or clear answers.
Part of being wise is knowing which questions to pursue and which to let go.
Encouraging curiosity in children helps them become lifelong learners.
But they also need to develop critical thinking to navigate today’s information overload.
Balancing curiosity with discernment creates thoughtful, informed individuals.
In this way, curiosity becomes a strength rather than a distraction."""

passage8 = """Good communication is at the heart of all strong relationships.
It involves not only speaking clearly but also listening actively.
Many misunderstandings come from assumptions rather than actual problems.
By asking questions and showing interest, people can avoid unnecessary conflict.
Nonverbal cues like tone and body language play a big role too.
Sometimes what you don’t say communicates more than words.
Being honest and respectful fosters trust over time.
In contrast, poor communication can damage even the strongest connections.
Improving how we express ourselves strengthens both personal and professional bonds.
Like any skill, communication gets better with practice and intention."""

passage9 = """The natural world offers countless benefits to our mental health.
Spending time in green spaces reduces stress and improves mood.
People who walk in nature regularly report feeling more relaxed and focused.
Even short exposures to natural light can boost energy levels.
In urban areas, adding plants to indoor spaces has a similar effect.
Nature helps us slow down and connect with something larger than ourselves.
This connection reminds us that we are part of a bigger system.
Caring for the environment also becomes more meaningful when we feel this bond.
Modern lifestyles often disconnect us from nature, but small changes can help.
Ultimately, a closer relationship with nature benefits both our minds and the planet."""

passage10 = """Decision-making is a skill that improves with experience and reflection.
Many people struggle with choices because they fear making mistakes.
But indecision often leads to missed opportunities or regret.
Accepting that no choice is perfect can ease the pressure.
What matters is making thoughtful decisions based on values and goals.
Taking time to evaluate options is useful, but overthinking can be paralyzing.
Learning from past decisions helps build confidence for future ones.
Good decision-makers also know when to seek advice from others.
Trusting your judgment doesn't mean ignoring input—it means balancing it.
With practice, decision-making becomes a tool for clarity, not confusion."""
